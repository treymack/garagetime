# Garage Time!

**Garage Time!** is designed to manage and analyze projects typically performed in a garage.  

From **small engine repairs** to **golf cart maintenance**, **woodworking builds**, or even **electronics tinkering**, this system provides a flexible platform for hobbyists, makers, and shops to organize, track, and optimize their work.

## ðŸ¤” Why GarageTime?

**Garage Time!** is a project I imagine I will use for my own garage-based projects.

The real reason though? I need a playground to experiment with modern software architecture and design patterns. Consider this a portfolio project.

I do need to keep costs down though, so this will be implemented using services on the free tier as much as possible. This won't be the place for kubernetes.
