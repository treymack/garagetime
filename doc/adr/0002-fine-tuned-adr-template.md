# ADR 2: Fine-tuned ADR Template

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Looking for inspiration, there are several existing ADR templates that can be adapted to fit our needs. `adr-tools` supports templating, so we can override the default templates with our own.

## Decision

We will use a template inspired by the book _Fundamentals of Software Architecture_.

## Consequences

This template adds a couple of new sections, including "Compliance" and "Notes," to encourage more thorough documentation of the decision-making process.

## Compliance

`adr-tools` will be configured to use the new template.

## Notes
